## UI (User Interface)

The design is not the primary concern of the package and is not implemented as visible in the screenshots.

‚úîÔ∏è **_The basic functional UI with no blocking UX is implemented._**

But the screenshots are taken from the actual use case where we modified things to match with our custom layouts in Limitless admin framework with Bootstrap 3.3.7.

## Known Issues (When not to use)

- **Variable number of Attachments not supported:**<br>
If you want to let the user add attachments on their choice, and there are no fixed attachments defined, this repository won't fit
- **No separate uploading (Larger files matter):**<br>
The module will store files (attachments) when the parent form will store data. If you are dealing with larger files and there are many types defined then the `max_input_vars` in `php.ini` needs to be revised, or altered using `.htaccess` with the resource [available here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2364875/1743124). (**Solution:** A possible solution could be to use JavaScript-based file upload)
- **JavaScript-based upload will change file path:**<br>
If the file upload part is managed using JavaScript upload, then the `/scope_key/scope_id/file.ext` concept won't work, and the files will be stored in `/year/month/file.ext` path, unless the `scope_id` is managed by any way

## Roadmap

- [ ] Facilitate to employ multiple segments in the same scope to accept segmented attachments
- [x] Make it more robust to use like a Laravel package
- [x] If a Laravel package is been developed, publish it to packagist.org
